COMPUTATIONAL CREATIVITY: GENERATIVE FASHION DESIGN WITH AI-DRIVEN SYSTEM

The fashion industry has seen a significant shift towards personalized and creative clothing production, leading to a growing demand for effective apparel design tools. In response, our Generative Fashion Design project was developed to enable users to realize their design ideas more effectively. Our project employs Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth as the primary model and algorithm for generating fashion designs, with a focus on exploring the boundaries of models generated by the DreamBooth method. The implementation of DreamBooth in the fashion domain is described in detail, including the underlying knowledge and the customization of the approach for generating creative clothing images. A prototype that is both user-friendly and comprehensive was created to streamline the fashion design process. Additionally, a testing method that is thorough and exhaustive was developed and will be presented. While the generative model has demonstrated promising results in generating innovative designs, certain limitations were identified, and future research directions were proposed. To sum up, fine-tuning a textto-image model using DreamBooth has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for fashion designers, enhancing their creativity, productivity, and workflows.
